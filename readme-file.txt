## 🎮 About The Game

**ddxCROOK** is an interactive terminal-based adventure game that puts you in the shoes of a medical student working with the intimidating but brilliant Dr. Crook! Your mission: diagnose a patient with mysterious symptoms while maintaining your reputation and keeping your anxiety in check.

This game combines clinical reasoning with the excitement of a text-based adventure. Make diagnostic choices, order tests, and ultimately solve the case - if you're good enough!

## 🚀 Features

- **Clinical Decision-Making**: Test your differential diagnosis skills
- **Character Stats System**: Tracks your anxiety level, reputation with Dr. Crook, and correct decisions
- **Multiple Endings**: Your performance determines how the story concludes
- **Medical Accuracy**: Based on a real clinical case (pheochromocytoma)
- **ASCII Art**: Beautiful terminal visuals

## 🔍 Gameplay

The game follows a medical student (you!) as you work with Dr. Crook to diagnose a 37-year-old woman with episodic symptoms including:
- Hypertension
- Tachycardia
- Headaches
- Diaphoresis
- Palpitations

Your decisions influence both the diagnostic process and your relationship with the intimidating Dr. Crook. Choose wisely!

## 🩺 How To Play

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the game: `python terminal_game.py`
3. Follow the prompts and make your choices
4. Try to reach the correct diagnosis while maintaining your reputation!

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

This project was developed as part of my journey through the "The Legend of Python" course on Codedex.io. Creating this game helped me practice:

- Python control flow (if/else statements, loops)
- Data structures (dictionaries for state management)
- Function definitions and organization
- Terminal input/output formatting
- String manipulation
- ASCII art integration

## 💭 Inspiration

ddxCROOK was inspired by my experiences in medical education and my love for both clinical reasoning and interactive storytelling. The character of Dr. Crook is a tribute to a supportive associate dean who guided students through challenging times.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Add more patient cases with different conditions
- Implement a time management system
- Include more complex branching dialogue
- Add a "medical student handbook" feature with clinical pearls

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

- Codedex.io for the amazing Python course
- Dell Medical School for the clinical education experiences that inspired this game
- Dr. Crook (you know who you are!) for being an incredible mentor
