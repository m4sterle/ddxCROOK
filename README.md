## üéÆ About the Game

Welcome to **ddxCROOK** - where medical education meets Python adventure! This text-based diagnostic experience throws you into the chaotic world of pediatric rotations, complete with:

- üß† Real clinical reasoning challenges
- üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è A terrifyingly omnipresent attending physician (Dr. Crook)
- üò∞ Authentic medical student anxiety simulation
- üí° Clinical pearls that might actually help you on rounds
- üèÜ A scoring system that's still less arbitrary than your clerkship grades

This game was developed as part of the **Legend of Python** course on Codedex.io, proving that you can simultaneously study medicine AND learn to code (though your social life may not survive the experience).

## Features

- üéÆ **Terminal-based gameplay** - command-line interfaces, player anxiety tracking, and more!
- üé® **Color-coded text** - no one wants to be stuck in an ugly terminal
- ü©∫ **Clinical accuracy** - Kawasaki Disease presentation based on actual diagnostic criteria
- üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Dynamic interactions with branching narratives** - multiple ways to induce eyebrow-raising behavior from your attending
- üéì **Educational value** - learn while you play! (it's practically "spaced repetition")
- ü§î **Hint system** - for when you're as lost in the differential as you are in the hospital hallways

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ddxCROOK.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd ddxCROOK

# Install required packages
pip install colorama

# Run the game
python ddxCROOK.py
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Colorama (for those beautiful terminal colors that make your diagnostic journey less soul-crushing)

## How to Play

1. Enter your name (use your real one if you're brave)
2. Follow the prompts to navigate your clinical encounters
3. Make diagnostic decisions based on the information provided
4. Type 'hint' at any decision point if you need clinical pearls
5. Try not to kill anyone (a surprisingly low bar for success)

## Sample Gameplay

```
Dr. Crook raises an eyebrow, seemingly impressed by your initiative.

'Temperature 39.8¬∞C, HR 130, RR 28, BP 95/60. Make of that what you will.'

(Your brain: 'High fever in a kid... infections, rheumatic fever, maybe something auto-inflammatory?')
```

## Educational Value

Despite the humor, this game teaches real clinical concepts:

- Classic presentation of Kawasaki Disease
- Proper diagnostic approach to pediatric fevers
- Appropriate workup for suspected inflammatory conditions
- Importance of timely diagnosis for conditions with time-sensitive treatments

## Future Diagnoses

Planning to expand with more cases, including:
- Meningitis Madness
- Appendicitis Adventure
- The Great Diabetic Ketoacidosis Debacle
- Intussusception: It's Not Just a Fun Word to Say

## Disclaimers

- This game is for educational purposes only
- Not a substitute for actual medical training
- If you're diagnosing real children based on a Python game, please reconsider your life choices
- No attendings were harmed in the making of this game (though several were mildly annoyed)

## Acknowledgments

- To all the intimidating attendings who inspired Dr. Crook
- To the pediatric patients who taught me more than any textbook
- To coffee, without which neither medicine nor coding would be possible
- To Codedex.io for the Legend of Python course that made this possible

## About the Creator

Former medical student turned tech explorer, using code to bridge the worlds of clinical reasoning and technology. This project represents my journey from medical school to programming, combining my passion for both fields into something that hopefully makes you laugh while you learn.
